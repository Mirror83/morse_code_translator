# Morse Code Translator

A simple command-line application that translate morse code sequences into their equivalent character sequences. Only works for morse code representations for characters in the range a-z in the English alphabet.

The translation is done using a decision tree. I know that using this is slower than just looking up the symbols using a map, but I just wanted to refresh my knowledge on trees. (And refresh on basic dart syntax and testing as well)

The encoding is done using good old map look-up.

## Getting started

To run the project, just clone this repository and run the command `dart run` in the project directory.

To run the tests, just run the command `dart test` in the project directory.
